# This is a Port from the official Livox Master branch.
I just quickly swapped all ros1 stuff to ros2 stuff and threw everything into one node and was quite surprised it worked first try.
Maybe there are some bugs or somthing might not be completly correct, but i thought it probably is better than nothing for anyone looking for a ros2 Version.
Feel free to submit any issues or request a merge, if you find something that could be done better.
All the code itself is from the original Livox master, i just replaced all the ros1 with ros2 stuff and fixed all the errors that popped up!
